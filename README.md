# Regression and Classification on life expectancy prediction
#### In this project task of regression was performed as well as various methods for classification. 
The research also included feature selection, regularization (lasso) and definition of decision tree models along with random forest and boosting in order to compare the performance of different algorithms.

The dataset conatains observations on various variables when it comes to [life expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) of people from different countries. 

In order to fit the problem for classification task classes of age groups were created in [data preprocessing](https://github.com/deszczowaa/Regression-and-Classification/blob/main/Data_preprocessing.ipynb).
